# Clockify MCP Server

This MCP server allows LLMs (such as Cursor or Claude) to interact with your Clockify workspace, enabling advanced time-tracking automation and reporting. With this server, you can:
- List all projects in your workspace
- List all users in your workspace
- Add and look up time entries for yourself or any user (if you have permissions)
- Pull timesheets for any user across all projects
- Generate monthly or custom date range breakdowns of hours by user and project using the Clockify summary report API
- Integrate with LLMs to automate, summarize, or analyze your time-tracking data
