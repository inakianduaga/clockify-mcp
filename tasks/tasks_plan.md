# Tasks Plan

## Completed Tasks
- Scaffolded MCP server using TypeScript and MCP SDK
- Implemented three MCP tools:
  - listProjects
  - getTimeEntries
  - addTimeEntry
- Integrated native fetch for Clockify API calls
- Configured authentication via MCP config (CLOCKIFY_API_KEY)
- Added Dockerfile and made Docker the primary deployment method
- Local Node.js supported as an alternative for development
- Updated all documentation (README, architecture, technical, PRD) to reflect Docker as the main deployment method

## Next Steps
- Monitor for issues or feature requests from LLM/Cursor integration
- Add more Clockify features as new MCP tools if needed
- Maintain and improve error handling, logging, and extensibility
